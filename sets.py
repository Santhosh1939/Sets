# # Write Python code to find and print the intersection of the following two sets:
# set1 = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
# set2 = {4, 5, 6, 7, 8}
# set3=set1.intersection(set2)
# print(set3)
# # Output : {4, 5}

# # Task 2: Set UnionWrite Python code to find and print the union of the following two sets:
# set1 = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
# set2 = {4, 5, 6, 7, 8}
# set3=set1.union(set2)
# print(set3)
# # Output : {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}

# # Task 3: Set Difference Write Python code to find and print the elements present in set1 but not in set2 :
# # set1 = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
# # set2 = {4, 5, 6, 7, 8}
# set3=set1.difference(set2)
# print(set3)
# # Output : {1, 2, 3}

# Task 4: Set Symmetric Difference
# Write Python code to find and print the symmetric difference of the following two sets:
# set1 = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
# set2 = {4, 5, 6, 7, 8}
# set3=set1.symmetric_difference(set2)
# print(set3)
# # Output: {1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8}

# # Task 5: Set Membership Test
# # Write Python code to check if the element 3 is present in the set my_set :
# my_set = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
# print((3)in my_set)
# # Output: True


# Exercise 1: Set Intersection
# Write a Python script that finds and prints the intersection of two sets.
set_1={"KS","GS","19","39"}
set_2={"ball","bat","19","39"}
# set_3=set_1.intersection(set_2)
# print(set_3)
# output:{'19', '39'}

# Exercise 2: Set Union
# Write a Python script that finds and prints the union of two sets.
# set_3=set_1.union(set_2)
# print(set_3)
# output: {'KS', '39', 'bat', 'ball', 'GS', '19'}

# Exercise 3: Set Difference
# Write a Python script that finds and prints the difference between two sets.
# set_3=set_1.difference(set_2)
# print(set_3)
# output:{'KS', 'GS'}

# Exercise 4: Set Symmetric Difference
# Write a Python script that finds and prints the symmetric difference between two sets.
# set_3=set_1.symmetric_difference(set_2)
# print(set_3)
# output:{'bat', 'ball', 'GS', 'KS'}
